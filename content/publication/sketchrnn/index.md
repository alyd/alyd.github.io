abstract: "Quick, draw a sandwich! What does it look like? If you were from South Korea, you may have added pickled cucumber, 
or if you were from Sweden you might have drawn a smörgås i.e. open-faced sandwich. The way we draw reflects our environment 
and culture. We explored using a neural representation to analyze thousands of sketches from across the world, and found it 
revealed fascinating differences across countries. We further investigated predicting the country from the drawing, finding 
which countries have the most distinctive drawings and which drawing categories show the most geographical variations."
