If you're an undergrad looking to do research with me, I am much more likely to respond if you email me with the following:
- why you'd like to work with me 
- a project idea that you'd be excited to work on
- your relevant knowledge and skills (resume, transcript)
- how much time you could spend on research- hours per week, for how many months
